From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

From this Project I have learnt:
1. How to manipulate elements with css.
2. How to layout the tags with basic html/css knowledge.
3. The best way to learn when stuck is to google and watch tutorials from you tube.
4. Using MDN web docs documentation and the W3S school website to complete the project.
5. The best way to learn is through consultations, and bulding different projects.
6. It was fun and enjoyable!!!!!
